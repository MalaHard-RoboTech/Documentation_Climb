    Hello!
Michele Focchi is a leading expert in motion planning and control of quadruped robots, and team leader of this project, with 16 years of experience in robotics and pioneering contributions to heuristic locomotion in unstructured terrains. His research combines control, optimization, and machine learning to improve quadruped performance in challenging environments. Currently a Professor at the University of Trento (DISI) and Scientific Advisor for All3, he was also a visiting scientist at IIT, where he co-founded the Dynamic Legged Systems Lab. He earned his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Control Systems Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a Ph.D. in Robotics from IIT, contributing to the Hydraulically Actuated Quadruped Robot project. Beyond academia, he has led industrial and academic projects with organizations like ESA, co-founded the MOOG-IIT joint lab, and delivered numerous invited talks. He is Associate Editor for RA-L and ICRA, has published over 53 papers, and supervised many Master’s and Ph.D. theses.

    Hello!

My name is Ruben Malacarne, and I am passionate about electronics, computer science, 3D mechanics, and telecommunications. From building homemade PCBs in high school to developing a high-frequency micro attenuator switch for my bachelor’s thesis, I have always pursued challenges that deepen my technical skills. After earning my Bachelor’s in Communication and Electronics Engineering, I worked at Bluetensor as an electronics engineer and 3D designer, an experience that reignited my passion for programming. I have also gained teamwork experience through the Eagle Trento Racing Team and creativity through Robowar competitions in the antweight category. Now in the final year of my Master’s degree, my goal is to absorb as much knowledge as possible and build something meaningful with the right team and mindset.

# Hardonk Luca (Mechanical engineer)

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    My goal is to build a fully autonomous humanoid robot, a dream that started with Arduino and early projects like an automated mop, parking assistant, and robotic lawn mower, which led me to learn Linux, ROS, and hardware design. At university, I built a CNC machine and a smart home system, while also exploring IT, servers, and networking. Robotics remained central with a butler robot for autonomy and AI, and I continue developing robotic arms to advance toward my vision
