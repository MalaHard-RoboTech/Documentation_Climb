inspired from orbiting satellites we can develop a high trust, very low elettrical power stabilization system using the onboard hign pressure lines like satellite do to orientate satellites into space.

## data:
we have a 200 bar air tank and a we can regulate the pressure at 4.5 for the piston but we can add any other regulator, let's choose 7 bars (for my compressor compatibility for testing)

need further calculation but i think i can produce around 100N of thrust juts by experimenting with my compressor.
